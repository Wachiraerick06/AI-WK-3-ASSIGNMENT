# AI Tools Assignment – MNIST Digit Classification

## Part 1: Theory
- Overview of AI tools (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch)
- Explained AI workflow: data preprocessing, model training, and deployment
- Discussed selection criteria for frameworks and ethical AI practices

## Part 2: Practical Implementation
- Goal: Classify handwritten digits (MNIST dataset) using TensorFlow
- Model: CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense, and Softmax layers
- Results: Accuracy – 99.14%, Loss – 0.0274
- Deployment: Streamlit app to upload and predict digits  
  `streamlit run app.py`

## Part 3: Ethics & Optimization
- Addressed potential data bias and fairness tools (TensorFlow Fairness, spaCy)
- Fixed TensorFlow bugs (input shape, loss, missing activation)
- Applied optimization: ReLU, Dropout, Adam optimizer
